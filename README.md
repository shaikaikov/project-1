# project-1-shai kaikov

in this project i learned how to build classs of polynom and monom.i use a lot of the iterator in order to build functions.my mistake in start was that the iterator its only copy the polynom,but after i did testers  i understood that was a pointer of the polynom.in this reason in the end i understood to build polynoms without change part of the polynoms. 
in addition the use of ArrayList was use a lot in order to build polynoms. 
in first i built the Monom class in order to build in the future the polynom class. 
i notice that that building this class will help me to build more classs in the future and that i need to invastgate more on polynoms. 
the complicaed functions were the root and the area in the polynom class.fastely i leran how to build this functions with the learning of the internet(use the wikipedia).and than i plan how to build the fucntions,beside this the testers help me too build the functions. 
in conclusion in order to do the best-i need to plan and invastigate the functions before i write them and do more testers.
